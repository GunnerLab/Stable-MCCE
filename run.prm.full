MCCE CONFIGURATION FILE (full 09/15/2004)
   This file must have name "run.prm" in the working directory. The first
   field of the line is the value, and last string with parenthesis is
   the key. Entries marked with * should be configured with your run.

   You need this configure file in your working directory.
   You need to point out a pdb file to work on.

   Optionally:
   You may need file defined by "RENAME_RULES" to customize cofactors.
   You may need file defined by "EXTRA" to customize advanced contols.

# The steps mcce will do. 't' is true (do), 'f' is false (not do). As step 3
# and step 4 are quite time consuming, one often stops right after step 2 to
# check the status such as the number of conformers. If the number of final
# conformers exceeds 5000, then step 3 and 4 will take over a week.
Steps:
